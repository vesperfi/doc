# VIP: Whitelist UNI and USDT for Vesper Pools
## Summary
Whitelist Uniswap (UNI) and Tether (USDT) as deposit assets to Vesper Pools.

## Abstract
Vesper seeks to ultimately support all major ERC20 tokens to optimize yield in a hands-free experience for the end user. UNI and USDT are prime candidates as next-in-line for integration.

As both of these tokens are widely accepted on major DeFi platforms, UNI and USDT can both leverage existing strategies that route through the likes of Maker, Compound, and Aave.
## Expectations
This proposal greenlights the creation of UNI and USDT Vesper Grow pools. Once strategies are modified for these tokens, those pools will be pushed to the [beta app](https://app.vesperdev.net)

After successful Beta run, USDT and UNI can graduate to the main app with optional VSP boost.
## Specification
UNI token contract: 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984
USDT token contract: 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7
