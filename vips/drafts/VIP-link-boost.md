# Boost vLINK Pool with VSP

## Summary
Apply a VSP boost to the vLINK pool so LINK depositors earn VSP on top of the underlying LINK yield.

## Abstract
In order to bootstrap participation to Vesper pools and properly circulate tokenized ownership of the platform, depositors to approved Vesper Grow pools share a pool of VSP rewards as a "boost" beyond their underlying yield. 

This proposal seeks to apply a similar boost to vLINK participants as is currently available to depositors across vETH, vWBTC, and vUSDC.

## Expectations
Following proposal acceptance, a new pool rewards contract will be created using the same specifications as rewards contracts for vETH, vWBTC, and vUSDC

On April 18th, the vLINK rewards contract will be filled with VSP and distributed proportionately to depositors over the course of the month.

These VSP rewards are budgeted out of the DAO Reserves and deposited to the proper contract.

Note that the community can propose extension to these rewards in the event that this proposal passes. If it fails, any number of counterproposals with revised rewards schedules may be introduced.

## Specification
One month funding delegated from the DAO Reserves to vLINK rewards contract using the same epoch as existing pool rewards.

* Month 1 (begins April 18th): 25,000 VSP
